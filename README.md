## Introduction

Supervised machine learning is one of the most widely used techniques in artificial intelligence. It involves learning a function from labeled data, where the function can either predict continuous values (regression) or classify data points into categories (classification).

In this repository, you'll find Python implementations of several key supervised learning algorithms, along with explanations and real-world examples.

## Features

- **Linear Regression**: Predict continuous outcomes using features.
- **Logistic Regression**: Classify data into binary classes.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Separate classes using a hyperplane.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classify points based on nearest neighbors.
- **Decision Trees**: Build tree-based models for classification.
- **Gradient Descent**: Implement gradient descent for learning.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Calculate metrics like RMSE, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
