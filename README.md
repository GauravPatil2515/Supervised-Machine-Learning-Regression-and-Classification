Introduction
Supervised machine learning is one of the most widely used techniques in artificial intelligence. It involves learning a function from labeled data, where the function can either predict continuous values (regression) or classify data points into categories (classification).

In this repository, you'll find Python implementations of several key supervised learning algorithms, along with explanations and real-world examples.

Features
Linear Regression: Predict continuous outcomes using features.
Logistic Regression: Classify data into binary classes.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Separate classes using a hyperplane.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classify points based on nearest neighbors.
Decision Trees: Build tree-based models for classification.
Gradient Descent: Implement gradient descent for learning.
Evaluation Metrics: Calculate metrics like RMSE, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, clone this repository and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/Supervised-Machine-Learning-Regression-and-Classification.git
cd Supervised-Machine-Learning-Regression-and-Classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or above installed on your system.

Usage
Once installed, you can start experimenting with different models and datasets by running the scripts provided.

Example of running a linear regression model:

bash
Copy code
python models/linear_regression.py
You can modify the script to use different datasets or tweak the hyperparameters as needed.

Algorithms
This repo includes the following algorithms:

Linear Regression: For predicting a continuous target variable.
Logistic Regression: For binary classification problems.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple yet powerful classification algorithm.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): An algorithm for creating the best decision boundary.
Decision Trees: A tree-based model for classification.
Each model is implemented from scratch in Python using libraries such as NumPy and Pandas. For visualization, Matplotlib and Seaborn are used.
